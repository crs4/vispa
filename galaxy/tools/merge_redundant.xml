**What it does**

This tool takes as input a file containing tabular (no header) BLAST
output and merges hits corresponding to the same integration site (IS)
as defined by the given window size. The output is a tabular file,
again with no header, with three columns:

1. chromosome tag

2. position of the IS within the chromosome

3. multiplicity (how many alignments are found in the corresponding window)
